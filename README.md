This repository contains all my work for the Computer Programming course during the second semester of my first year in the Computer Science course

1. Laboratory Activity 1: EmployeeInformationSystem

   Laboratory Activity 1: Employee Information System is designed to create a simple employee management system that collects essential data and calculates the employee's daily salary based on the number of hours worked and their hourly wage. The purpose of this system is to provide a basic approach to handling employee information in an interactive manner.In this system, the user (either the employee or HR representative) is prompted to enter personal and work-related details, such as the first name, last name, age, hours worked per day, and hourly wage. These details are then used to compute the employeeâ€™s daily salary, which is displayed as the output.

3. Laboratory Activitity 2:EmployeeInformationSystemPart2

   Laboratory Activity 2: Employee Information System Part 2 extends the functionality of the previous system by introducing additional features, such as salary breakdown and deductions, as well as retirement calculations. This activity is designed to introduce more complex logic to the employee management system. The purpose of this activity is to build upon the basic structure created in Activity 1 by adding more comprehensive calculations and enhancing the user experience. Specifically, this activity allows the user to input personal and work-related data and then computes the daily salary, weekly salary, monthly salary, gross yearly salary, and net yearly salary

3.Laboratory Activitity 3: ConditionalStatement
    
    Laboratory Activity 3 focuses on using conditional statements to make decisions based on user input or predefined criteria, allowing the program to evaluate conditions and execute specific actions accordingly. In the context of the Employee Information System, the program checks the employee's age and hours worked, ensuring that employees under 18 or over 65 are rejected, and that the entered work hours are valid (e.g., no more than 24 hours). This activity emphasizes the importance of data validation and business rule enforcement through conditional logic, a key concept in software development.
  
4.Laboratory Activitity 4: EmployeeSystemGUI
    
    Laboratory Activity 4: Employee System GUI aims to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Employee Information System, transforming it from a command-line application to a more user-friendly desktop application. The GUI allows users to easily enter employee information, such as first name, last name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage, and displays the daily salary in a formatted result area. The activity focuses on using Swing components like JTextField, JButton, JLabel, and JTextArea to build interactive interfaces and emphasizes event-driven programming, where user actions trigger tasks like salary calculations. It also incorporates data validation to ensure accurate inputs, helping students understand the importance of input validation and error handling in software development.

5.Laboratory Activitity 5: QuizAppAWT
  
  Laboratory Activity 5: QuizAppAWT aims to create an interactive quiz application using AWT in Java, where users answer questions by selecting predefined options, and the application calculates and displays their score. The activity focuses on using AWT components like Button, Checkbox, Label, and TextField to build a user-friendly interface. Students will learn to implement event-driven programming, where actions like button clicks trigger specific tasks, such as validating user input and calculating the score. The exercise reinforces concepts in UI design, event handling, and logic implementation in Java, providing hands-on experience with managing user interactions and tracking progress.

6.Laboratory Activitity 6: SwingToDoList
  
  Laboratory Activity 6: SwingToDoList focuses on developing a To-Do List application using Java's Swing framework. This activity aims to teach students how to design and implement a desktop application where users can add, view, and manage tasks with a simple graphical interface. The Swing components used, such as JTable, JTextField, JTextArea, JComboBox, and JButton, enable the creation of interactive elements for task entry and display. The application includes features like a task form for adding new tasks, displaying tasks in a table, and a status dropdown to track task progress, reinforcing the importance of GUI design, event handling, and data management in Java

7. Midterm Laboratory Exam: Midterm Laboratory Exam: IT_Ticket_System
     Midterm Laboratory Exam: IT_Ticket_System is a Java-based console application that allows users to manage IT support tickets, including adding tickets, updating their status, and generating reports. The system features a limit on the number of tickets, tracks ticket urgency (Low/Medium/High), and allows users to change the status of a ticket to either "In Progress" or "Resolved." It teaches students how to use arrays for data storage, implement control flow for input validation, and manage simple ticketing operations. The activity also emphasizes understanding basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and user interaction.

8. Final Laboratory Exam: Calculator
     The Calculator is a graphical calculator built using Java Swing, featuring a pastel-themed interface with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, advanced functions like square roots, exponents, and factorials, and functionalities like clear, delete, and sign toggle. The main components include a JFrame for the window, a JTextField for displaying inputs and results, a JLabel for showing the operation, and a GridLayout to organize the buttons. Each button is styled with pastel colors, and an ActionListener handles user input, performing calculations based on the clicked buttons and updating the display accordingly. The program also ensures proper formatting for decimal numbers and handles errors such as division by zero and invalid factorials
